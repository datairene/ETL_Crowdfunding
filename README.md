# Crowdfunding_ETL
In this project I used the ETL pipeline to examine crowdfunding. I took a deeper look into how various factors impact the effectiveness of the campaign. I used Python, Pandas and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and used those files to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database. This project is a great use of the extract, transfrom, and load (ETL) process. ETL is a data integration process that combines data from multiple sources into a single, consistent data set for storage in a data warehuse or other target system.
